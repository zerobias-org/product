To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.

      Triggers a user event rejoin operation with latest product catalog. Events will not be annotated with detailed product information if product is missing from the catalog at the time the user event is ingested, and these events are stored as unjoined events with a limited usage on training and serving. This API can be used to trigger a 'join' operation on specified events with latest version of product catalog. It can also be used to correct events joined with wrong product catalog.

      Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.
