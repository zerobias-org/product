      Deletes the settings associated with a project, folder, or organization. This will have the effect of disabling Access Approval for the project, folder, or organization, but only if all ancestors also have Access Approval disabled. If Access Approval is enabled at a higher level of the hierarchy, then Access Approval will still be enabled at this level as the settings are inherited.
