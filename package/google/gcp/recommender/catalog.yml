      Marks the Recommendation State as Failed. Users can use this method to indicate to the Recommender API that they have applied the recommendation themselves, and the operation failed. This stops the recommendation content from being updated. Associated insights are frozen and placed in the ACCEPTED state. MarkRecommendationFailed can be applied to recommendations in ACTIVE, CLAIMED, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED state. Requires the recommender.*.update IAM permission for the specified recommender.

      Marks the Recommendation State as Failed. Users can use this method to indicate to the Recommender API that they have applied the recommendation themselves, and the operation failed. This stops the recommendation content from being updated. Associated insights are frozen and placed in the ACCEPTED state. MarkRecommendationFailed can be applied to recommendations in ACTIVE, CLAIMED, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED state. Requires the recommender.*.update IAM permission for the specified recommender.
