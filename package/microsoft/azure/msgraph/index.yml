description: With Microsoft Graph, you can access Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
  resources to enable scenarios like managing administrator (directory) roles, inviting
  external users to an organization, and, if you are a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP),
  managing your customer's data. Microsoft Graph also provides methods that apps can
  use to, for example, discover information about users' transitive group and role
  memberships.
