Operations:
  AddTagsToStream:
    description: |-
      Adds or updates tags for the specified Kinesis data stream. You can assign up to 50 tags to a data stream.
    versions:
      from: 2013.12.2
    link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_AddTagsToStream.html
    example:
      inputs: [
        {
          "Tags": {
            "string": "string"
          },
          "StreamName": "string"
        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  CreateStream:
    description: |-
      Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or producers. Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a stream.
    versions:
      from: 2013.12.2
    link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStream.html

        {}
      ]
  DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod:

  DeleteStream:
    description: |-
      Deletes a Kinesis data stream and all its shards and data. You must shut down any applications that are operating on the stream before you delete the stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted stream, it receives the exception ResourceNotFoundException.

      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  DeregisterStreamConsumer:
    description: |-
      To deregister a consumer, provide its ARN. Alternatively, you can provide the ARN of the data stream and the name you gave the consumer when you registered it. You may also provide all three parameters, as long as they don't conflict with each other. If you don't know the name or ARN of the consumer that you want to deregister, you can use the ListStreamConsumers operation to get a list of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently registered with a given data stream. The description of a consumer contains its name and ARN.

  MergeShards:
    description: |-
      Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.

  RegisterStreamConsumer:
    description: |-
      Registers a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this operation, the consumer you register can then call SubscribeToShard to receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.

  RemoveTagsFromStream:
    description: |-

  SplitShard:
    description: |-
      Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to increase the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. SplitShard is called when there is a need to increase the overall capacity of a stream because of an expected increase in the volume of data records being ingested.
