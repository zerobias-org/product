Operations:
  AbortVaultLock:
    description: |-
      This operation stops the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the Locked state. If the vault lock is in the Locked state when this operation is requested, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. Stopping the vault locking process removes the vault lock policy from the specified vault.
    versions:
      from: 2012.6.1
    link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-AbortVaultLock.html
    example:
      inputs: [
        {
          "accountId": "string",
          "vaultName": "string"
        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  AddTagsToVault:
    description: |-
      This operation adds the specified tags to a vault. Each tag is composed of a key and a value. Each vault can have up to 50 tags. If your request would cause the tag limit for the vault to be exceeded, the operation throws the LimitExceededException error.

          "Tags": {
            "string": "string"
          },
          "accountId": "string",
          "vaultName": "string"
        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  DeleteArchive:
    description: |-
      This operation deletes an archive from a vault. You can delete one archive at a time from a vault. To delete the archive you must provide its archive ID in the delete request. You can get the archive ID by downloading the vault inventory for the vault that contains the archive. For more information about downloading the vault inventory, see Downloading a Vault Inventory in Amazon S3 Glacier.

          "archiveId": "string",
          "vaultName": "string"
        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  UploadArchive:
    description: |-
      This operation adds an archive to a vault. For a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. In response, Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) returns the archive ID in the x-amz-archive-id header of the response. You should save the archive ID returned so that you can access the archive later.

          "checksum": "string",
          "accountId": "string",
          "vaultName": "string",
          "archiveDescription": "string"
        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {
          "checksum": "string",
          "location": "string",
          "archiveId": "string"
        }
      ]
  CompleteVaultLock:
    description: |-
      This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the InProgress state to the Locked state, which causes the vault lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the InProgress state by calling Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy). You can obtain the state of the vault lock by calling Get Vault Lock (GET lock-policy). For more information about the vault locking process, see Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock.

        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  DeleteVaultAccessPolicy:
    description: |-
      This operation deletes the access policy associated with the specified vault. The operation is eventually consistent—that is, it might take some time for Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) to completely remove the access policy, and you might still see the effect of the policy for a short time after you send the delete request.

        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  DescribeJob:
    description: |-
      This operation returns information about a job you previously initiated, including the job initiation date, the user who initiated the job, the job status code/message, and the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to notify after Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) completes the job. For more information about initiating a job, see Initiate Job (POST jobs).

  DeleteVault:
    description: |-
      This operation deletes a vault. Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) will delete a vault only if there are no archives in the vault as per the last inventory and there have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails (that is, the vault is not removed) and S3 Glacier returns an error.

  DescribeVault:
    description: |-
      This operation returns information about a vault, including the vault Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the date the vault was created, the number of archives contained within the vault, and the total size of all the archives in the vault. The number of archives and their total size are as of the last vault inventory Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) generated (see Working with Vaults in Amazon S3 Glacier). S3 Glacier generates vault inventories approximately daily. This means that if you add or remove an archive from a vault, and then immediately send a Describe Vault request, the response might not reflect the changes.

  DeleteVaultNotifications:
    description: |-
      This operation deletes the notification configuration set for a vault Set Vault Notification Configuration (PUT notification-configuration). The operation is eventually consistent—that is, it might take some time for Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) to completely disable the notifications, and you might still receive some notifications for a short time after you send the delete request.

  GetVaultNotifications:
    description: |-
      This operation retrieves the notification-configuration subresource set on the vault (see Set Vault Notification Configuration (PUT notification-configuration).

  SetVaultNotifications:
    description: |-
      Retrieving an archive and a vault inventory are asynchronous operations in Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) for which you must first initiate a job and wait for the job to complete before you can download the job output. You can configure a vault to post a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when these jobs complete. You can use this operation to set notification configuration on the vault. For more information, see Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier.
