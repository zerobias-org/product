  write.CreateDatabase:

      Creates a new Timestream database. If the KMS key is not specified, the database will be encrypted with a Timestream managed KMS key located in your account. Refer to AWS managed KMS keys for more info. Service quotas apply. See code sample for details.

  write.CreateTable:
    description: |-
      The CreateTable operation adds a new table to an existing database in your account. In an AWS account, table names must be at least unique within each Region if they are in the same database. You may have identical table names in the same Region if the tables are in seperate databases. While creating the table, you must specify the table name, database name, and the retention properties. Service quotas apply. See code sample for details.

      Modifies the retention duration of the memory store and magnetic store for your Timestream table. Note that the change in retention duration takes effect immediately. For example, if the retention period of the memory store was initially set to 2 hours and then changed to 24 hours, the memory store will be capable of holding 24 hours of data, but will be populated with 24 hours of data 22 hours after this change was made. Timestream does not retrieve data from the magnetic store to populate the memory store.

  write.WriteRecords:
    description: |-
      The WriteRecords operation enables you to write your time series data into Timestream. You can specify a single data point or a batch of data points to be inserted into the system. Timestream offers you with a flexible schema that auto detects the column names and data types for your Timestream tables based on the dimension names and data types of the data points you specify when invoking writes into the database. Timestream support eventual consistency read semantics. This means that when you query data immediately after writing a batch of data into Timestream, the query results might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The results may also include some stale data. If you repeat the query request after a short time, the results should return the latest data. Service quotas apply.
