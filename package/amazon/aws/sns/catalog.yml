  CheckIfPhoneNumberIsOptedOut:
    description: |-
      Accepts a phone number and indicates whether the phone holder has opted out of receiving SMS messages from your account. You cannot send SMS messages to a number that is opted out.

      ]
  ConfirmSubscription:
    description: |-
      Verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier Subscribe action. If the token is valid, the action creates a new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call requires an AWS signature only when the AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe flag is set to "true".

  CreatePlatformApplication:
    description: |-

      ]
  CreatePlatformEndpoint:
    description: |-
      Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and APNS. CreatePlatformEndpoint requires the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from CreatePlatformApplication. You can use the returned EndpointArn to send a message to a mobile app or by the Subscribe action for subscription to a topic. The CreatePlatformEndpoint action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications.

  CreateTopic:
    description: |-

This action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns a topic with the specified name, that topic's ARN is returned without creating a new topic.
