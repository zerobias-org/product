      Retrieves metadata about one or more pipelines.

  PollForTask:
    description: |-
      Task runners call PollForTask to receive a task to perform from AWS Data Pipeline. The task runner specifies which tasks it can perform by setting a value for the workerGroup parameter.

  ReportTaskProgress:
    description: |-
      Task runners call ReportTaskProgress when assigned a task to acknowledge that it has the task. If the web service does not receive this acknowledgement within 2 minutes, it assigns the task in a subsequent PollForTask call. After this initial acknowledgement, the task runner only needs to report progress every 15 minutes to maintain its ownership of the task. You can change this reporting time from 15 minutes by specifying a reportProgressTimeout field in your pipeline.
    versions:
      from: 2012.10.29
    link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/APIReference/API_ReportTaskProgress.html

        }
      ]
  ReportTaskRunnerHeartbeat:
    description: |-
      Task runners call ReportTaskRunnerHeartbeat every 15 minutes to indicate that they are operational. If the AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner is launched on a resource managed by AWS Data Pipeline, the web service can use this call to detect when the task runner application has failed and restart a new instance.
    versions:
      from: 2012.10.29

  SetStatus:
    description: |-
      Requests that the status of the specified physical or logical pipeline objects be updated in the specified pipeline. This update might not occur immediately, but is eventually consistent. The status that can be set depends on the type of object (for example, DataNode or Activity). You cannot perform this operation on FINISHED pipelines and attempting to do so returns InvalidRequestException.

        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  SetTaskStatus:
    description: |-
      Task runners call SetTaskStatus to notify AWS Data Pipeline that a task is completed and provide information about the final status. A task runner makes this call regardless of whether the task was sucessful. A task runner does not need to call SetTaskStatus for tasks that are canceled by the web service during a call to ReportTaskProgress.
