Operations:
  AddTagsToCertificate:
    description: |-
      Adds one or more tags to an ACM certificate. Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You specify the certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify the tag by using a key-value pair.

          "CertificateArn": "string"
        }
      ]
      outputs: [
        {}
      ]
  DeleteCertificate:
    description: |-
      Deletes a certificate and its associated private key. If this action succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the list that can be displayed by calling the ListCertificates action or be retrieved by calling the GetCertificate action. The certificate will not be available for use by AWS services integrated with ACM.

  ExportCertificate:
    description: |-
      Exports a private certificate issued by a private certificate authority (CA) for use anywhere. The exported file contains the certificate, the certificate chain, and the encrypted private 2048-bit RSA key associated with the public key that is embedded in the certificate. For security, you must assign a passphrase for the private key when exporting it.

  ResendValidationEmail:
    description: |-
      Resends the email that requests domain ownership validation. The domain owner or an authorized representative must approve the ACM certificate before it can be issued. The certificate can be approved by clicking a link in the mail to navigate to the Amazon certificate approval website and then clicking I Approve. However, the validation email can be blocked by spam filters. Therefore, if you do not receive the original mail, you can request that the mail be resent within 72 hours of requesting the ACM certificate. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since your original request or since your last attempt to resend validation mail, you must request a new certificate. For more information about setting up your contact email addresses, see Configure Email for your Domain.
