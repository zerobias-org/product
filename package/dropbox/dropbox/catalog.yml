      Overwrite property groups associated with a file.

In other words, this endpoint will delete all omitted fields from a property group, whereas :route:`properties/update` will only delete fields that are explicitly marked for deletion.

      Create multiple folders at once.
      This route is asynchronous for large batches, which returns a job ID immediately and runs the create folder batch asynchronously. Otherwise, creates the folders and returns the result synchronously for smaller inputs. You can force asynchronous behaviour by using the :field:`CreateFolderBatchArg.force_async` flag.  Use :route:`create_folder_batch/check` to check the job status.

      Delete the file or folder at a given path.
      If the path is a folder, all its contents will be deleted too.
      A successful response indicates that the file or folder was deleted. The returned metadata will be the corresponding :type:`FileMetadata` or :type:`FolderMetadata` for the item at time of deletion, and not a :type:`DeletedMetadata` object.

      Starts returning the contents of a folder. If the result's :field:`ListFolderResult.has_more` field is :val:`true`, call :route:`list_folder/continue` with the returned :field:`ListFolderResult.cursor` to retrieve more entries.
      If you're using :field:`ListFolderArg.recursive` set to :val:`true` to keep a local cache of the contents of a Dropbox account, iterate through each entry in order and process them as follows to keep your local state in sync:
      For each :type:`FileMetadata`, store the new entry at the given path in your local state. If the required parent folders don't exist yet, create them. If there's already something else at the given path, replace it and remove all its children.
      For each :type:`FolderMetadata`, store the new entry at the given path in your local state. If the required parent folders don't exist yet, create them. If there's already something else at the given path, replace it but leave the children as they are. Check the new entry's :field:`FolderSharingInfo.read_only` and set all its children's read-only statuses to match.
      For each :type:`DeletedMetadata`, if your local state has something at the given path, remove it and all its children. If there's nothing at the given path, ignore this entry.
      Note: :type:`auth.RateLimitError` may be returned if multiple :route:`list_folder` or :route:`list_folder/continue` calls with same parameters are made simultaneously by same API app for same user. If your app implements retry logic, please hold off the retry until the previous request finishes.

    description: |-
      Returns revisions for files based on a file path or a file id. The file path or file id is identified from the latest file entry at the given file path or id. This end point allows your app to query either by file path or file id by setting the mode parameter appropriately.
      In the :field:`ListRevisionsMode.path` (default) mode, all revisions at the same file path as the latest file entry are returned. If revisions with the same file id are desired, then mode must be set to :field:`ListRevisionsMode.id`. The :field:`ListRevisionsMode.id` mode is useful to retrieve revisions for a given file across moves or renames.

  FilesUploadSessionFinishBatch:
    description: |-
      This route helps you commit many files at once into a user's Dropbox. Use :route:`upload_session/start` and :route:`upload_session/append_v2` to upload file contents. We recommend uploading many files in parallel to increase throughput. Once the file contents have been uploaded, rather than calling :route:`upload_session/finish`, use this route to finish all your upload sessions in a single request.
      :field:`UploadSessionStartArg.close` or :field:`UploadSessionAppendArg.close` needs to be true for the last :route:`upload_session/start` or :route:`upload_session/append_v2` call. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB.
      This route will return a job_id immediately and do the async commit job in background. Use :route:`upload_session/finish_batch/check` to check the job status.
      For the same account, this route should be executed serially. That means you should not start the next job before current job finishes. We allow up to 1000 entries in a single request.

  FilesUploadSessionStart:
    description: |-
      Upload sessions allow you to upload a single file in one or more requests, for example where the size of the file is greater than 150 MB.  This call starts a new upload session with the given data. You can then use :route:`upload_session/append_v2` to add more data and :route:`upload_session/finish` to save all the data to a file in Dropbox.
      A single request should not upload more than 150 MB. The maximum size of a file one can upload to an upload session is 350 GB.
      An upload session can be used for a maximum of 48 hours. Attempting to use an :field:`UploadSessionStartResult.session_id` with :route:`upload_session/append_v2` or :route:`upload_session/finish` more than 48 hours after its creation will return a :field:`UploadSessionLookupError.not_found`.

Some cursors might be short-lived some cursors might be long-lived.\nThis really depends on the sorting type and order, e.g.:\n1. on one hand, listing docs created by the user, sorted by the created time ascending will have undefinite expiration because the results cannot change while the iteration is happening. This cursor would be suitable for long term polling.\n2. on the other hand, listing docs sorted by the last modified time will have a very short expiration as docs do get modified very often and the modified time can be changed while the iteration is happening thus altering the results.\n"

  SharingAddFolderMember:
    description: |-
      Allows an owner or editor (if the ACL update policy allows) of a shared folder to add another member.
      For the new member to get access to all the functionality for this folder, you will need to call :route:`mount_folder` on their behalf.
      Apps must have full Dropbox access to use this endpoint.

  SharingCreateSharedLink:
    description: |-
      Create a shared link.
      If a shared link already exists for the given path, that link is returned.
      Note that in the returned :type:`PathLinkMetadata`, the :field:`PathLinkMetadata.url` field is the shortened URL if :field:`CreateSharedLinkArg.short_url` argument is set to :val:`true`.
      Previously, it was technically possible to break a shared link by moving or renaming the corresponding file or folder. In the future, this will no longer be the case, so your app shouldn't rely on this behavior. Instead, if your app needs to revoke a shared link, use :route:`revoke_shared_link`.

      Get members of multiple files at once. The arguments to this route are more limited, and the limit on query result size per file is more strict. To customize the results more, use the individual file endpoint.

  SharingShareFolder:
    description: |-
      Share a folder with collaborators.
      Most sharing will be completed synchronously. Large folders will be completed asynchronously. To make testing the async case repeatable, set `ShareFolderArg.force_async`.
      If a :field:`ShareFolderLaunch.async_job_id` is returned, you'll need to call :route:`check_share_job_status` until the action completes to get the metadata for the folder.
      Apps must have full Dropbox access to use this endpoint.
