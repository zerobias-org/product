  Monitor vulnerabilities in dependencies used in your project and keep your dependencies up-to-date with Dependabot.
background: >-
  Dependabot alerts tell you when your code depends on a package that is insecure. Often, software is built using open-source code packages from a large variety of sources. The complex relationships between these dependencies, and the ease with which malicious actors can insert malware into upstream code, mean that you may unknowingly be using dependencies that have security flaws, also known as vulnerabilities.

  If your code depends on a package with a security vulnerability, this can cause a range of problems for your project or the people who use it. Using a vulnerable package makes you a soft target for malicious users looking to exploit your system. For example, they may seek to get access to your code and data from your customers or contributors. You should upgrade to a secure version of the package as soon as possible. If your code uses malware, you need to replace the package with a secure alternative.

  Dependabot doesn't generate Dependabot alerts for malware.
