  - The option to enable or disable GitHub Codespaces
    - Organization owners can choose to enable or disable GitHub Codespaces for the organization's private repositories, and can pay for the usage of members and collaborators. For more information, see Enabling or disabling GitHub Codespaces for your organization and Choosing who owns and pays for codespaces in your organization.

  GitHub bills for GitHub Team on a per-user basis. For more information, see About per-user pricing.

  GitHub Actions usage is free for standard GitHub-hosted runners in public repositories, and for self-hosted runners. See Choosing the runner for a job. For private repositories, each GitHub account receives a certain amount of free minutes and storage for use with GitHub-hosted runners, depending on the account's plan. Any usage beyond the included amounts is controlled by spending limits.
